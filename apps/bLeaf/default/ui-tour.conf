stepText2 = To start with your search experience, imagine that you are part of a team that is investigating a technology problem that has a definitive business impact. From an operational perspective you will be able use search criteria with details that are relevant to that investigation within seconds. In the olden days you would have to visit various teams, databases, applications in order to combine all of the data to create a single point of view.
stepText1 = The advantage of using Splunk for alerting functions is on the conditional relationship that is automated with each individual alert. For example, a CPU may sometimes offer a high percentage use and traditional counter agents see that as a risk. In Splunk, you can extrapolate the relationship between a CPU usage spike and application response. Hence, if the behavior is observed repeatedly across a period of time, then an alert is triggered.

stepText3 = The immediate benefits of having all of your systemic alerts in one place can be summarized with access control, event replay and cross-investigation. When you have full context of a triggering condition, you are able to improve your operational response exponentially and without limits.
stepText2 = What happens today when you want to investigate an alert trigger by a traditional monitoring system? In most cases you have the result of the alert and its meaning. If you are required to investigate further, you will need direct access to the element affected so you can observe first-hand. With Splunk you have complete control of the historic footprints left behind by the event with a single click.
stepText1 = Another key factor in alerting with Splunk is the instant replay derived from the conditions observed in your data exploration. For instance, finding a significant condition that merits an alert may trigger an investigation across multiple lines of business. When the data is at hand, not only is it possible to drill down into the problem but also across other potential contributors for knowledge gathering.

In this scenario you have found error and failure messages. At this point you are dealing with a subset of data and you can focus our attention toward those sources that need it the most. The typical scenario here is that you will find an attention-grabbing event; the best case scenario is that you learn something meaningful that can be automated and shared across your entire organization.
stepText1 = Splunk dashboards are a culmination of labor in which you consolidate knowledge for collaboration. A dashboard captures key informational findings and analyses which allow you to interact, collaborate and explore findings with a dedicated context. For example, dashboards can be used to reflect an operational viewpoint of your various supporting IT layers. Also, you can enrich results by extrapolating relationships in your data exploration and associating third-party information to augment the end user experience. Thus, you turn an operational viewpoint to a business perspective very quickly.
