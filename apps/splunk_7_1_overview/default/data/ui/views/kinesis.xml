            The AWS Kinesis Firehose integration enables you to stream data from various AWS services directly into Splunk software reliably and at scaleâ€”all from the AWS console. This integration complements the existing data ingestion capabilities of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services and Lambda Blueprints for Splunk, and brings a wide range of additional advantages that include:
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Fully managed service with serverless architecture:</strong> don't worry about managing and scaling your data collection nodes - this is all managed for you. </li>
                <li> <strong>Greater reliability and scalability</strong> by leveraging HTTP event collector indexer acknowledgement and natively handling back pressure by allowing you to persists undelivered data to an S3 bucket. </li>
                <li> <strong>Well integrated with various AWS data</strong> sources such as VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch logs, CloudWatch Events and AWS IoT. </li>
                <li> <strong>Easy to use</strong> with no programming requirement. </li>
                <li> <strong>Ability to transform raw data</strong> prior to sending it to Splunk software: use lambda as needed to normalize the data prior to indexing it in Splunk software. </li>
                <li> <strong>Simplified architecture:</strong> bypass the need for setting up and managing forwarders by streaming your data directly to Splunk indexers. </li>
            </ul>

        <p>This is a direct integration with AWS, so you will be able to select Splunk as the destination for Kinesis Firehose delivery from your AWS Management Console.
