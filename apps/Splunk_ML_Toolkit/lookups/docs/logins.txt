1. Objective:
  We want to forecast the number of logins by hour and identify when the actual number of logins differs significantly from our forecast.

2. License: Free to use, collected by Splunk.

3. Data Source:
  Okta login counts from an anonymous company.

4. Data Set Information:
  The dataset contains about four weeks of login counts by hour, culminating in Thanksgiving week.

5. Field Meanings:
  A. _time: UNIX epoch time
  B. logins: the number of logins seen during that hour
  C. residual (created during the detect numeric outliers example): the difference between the predicted and actual values

6. Parameter Selection:
  A. Dashboard: Forecast Time Series
      Settings:
    1) Method: LLP
    2) Withhold: 114
    3) Forecast: 36
  B. Dashboard: Detect Numeric Outliers
      Settings:
    1) Search: | inputlookup logins.csv | predict logins as prediction algorithm=LLP future_timespan=150 holdback=0 | eval residual = prediction - logins
    2) Field to analyze: residual
    3) Method: median absolute deviation
    4) Multiplier: 9
    5) Sliding window: 72
