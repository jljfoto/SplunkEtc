	B. land_zone: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
	C. business_acres: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
	D. charles_river_adjacency: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
	E. nitric_oxide_concentration: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
	F. avg_rooms_per_dwelling: Average number of rooms per dwelling
	G. units_prior_1940: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
	H. distance_to_employment_center: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
	I. highway_accessibility_index: Index of accessibility to radial highways
	J. property_tax_rate: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
	K. pupil_teacher_ratio: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
	L. median_house_value: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

6. Parameter Selection:
	A. Dashboard Usage: Predict Numerical Fields for business analyst role.
	Settings:
