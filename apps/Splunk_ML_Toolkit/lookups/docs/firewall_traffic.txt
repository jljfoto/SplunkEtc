Objective: We want to predict whether the firewall is going to be affected by malware or not or has a vulnerability or not based on various traffic indicators on the firewall.1.	License: Free to use2.	Data Source: Corporate network3.	Field Meanings:	A. receive_time: Time when the log was received from the firewall.	B. has_known_vulnerability: Indicates whether the interface has known vulnerabilities or not.	C. session_id: Numerical identifier for the session.	D. src_ip: Anonymized IP of the session source.	E. dst_ip: Anonymized IP of the session destination.	F. bytes_sent: Number of bytes sent from the client to the server.	G. bytes_received: Number of bytes received by the client from the server.	H. packets_sent: Number of packets sent from the client to the server.	I. packets_received: Number of packets received by the client from the server.	J. dest_port: Destination port.	K. src_port: Source port.	L. used_by_malware: Affected by malware or not.4.	Parameter Selection:	A. Dashboard usage: Predict Categorical Fields	B. Field to predict: used_by_malware or has_known_vulnerability	C. Field to use for predicting: bytes_sent, bytes_received, packets_sent, packets_received, dest_port, src_port, has_known_vulnerability (if field to predict is used_by_malware), used_by_malware (if field to predict is has_known_vulnerability)
