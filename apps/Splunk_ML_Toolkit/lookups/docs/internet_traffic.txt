4. Data Set Information:
  Internet traffic data (in bits) from a private ISP with centers in 11 European cities. The data corresponds to a transatlantic link and was collected from 06:57 hours on 7 June to 11:17 hours on 31 July 2005. Data collected at five minute intervals.

5. Field Meanings:
  A. _time: UNIX epoch time (local time)
  B. bits_transferred: Data transferred in bits and collected at five-minute intervals, aggregated in 120-minute bin size.
