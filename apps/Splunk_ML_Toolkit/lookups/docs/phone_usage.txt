4. Data Set Information:
  This dataset contains 142 days of mobile phone records. The data is from the mobile phone of Czech Ph.D. student Michal Ficek, between 2010 and 2011.

5. Field Meanings:
  A. _time: date and time
  B. type: Voice, SMS, or Data
  C. direction: Incoming, Outgoing, or Missed. (Note: when type=Data, the direction is always outgoing.)
  D. duration: a value in seconds when type=Voice. It's equal to 0 when type=SMS. (I am not sure what duration means when type=Data. It may be data usage.)

6. Parameter Selection:
  A. Dashboard: Detect Categorical Outliers
      Settings:
    1) Search: | inputlookup phone_usage.csv | eval _time=strptime(_time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") | where type="Voice" | timechart count("duration") span=12h by direction
    2) Fields to use: Incoming, Missed call, Outgoing
