imageCaption1 = Welcome to the Machine Learning Toolkit. This app consists of four components: (1) the Showcase, which provides working examples on real datasets, (2) the Experiment, which guide you through using the tools, (3) the models, where you can find all your old ML models and those created using SPL, and (4) the "Classic" workflow, consisting of Alerts, Scheduled Training, and Assistants that fall outside of the Experiments workflow.
imageName1 = MLTK_1.png
imageCaption2 = The Showcase is organized by 6 assistants and below the description of each Assistant is a list of examples on real datasets. Click on the example to pre-populate the assistant with the example dataset and its settings. To see only examples from a particular domain, use the pulldown menu near the top of the page.

imageCaption3 = Experiments is the area where you can create, validate and operationalize Machine Learning models. There are 6 different types of experiments that can be created based on the assistant used. Select the appropriate assistant block to list the experiments created using that assistant. Further expand the experiment entry to get additional details of the experiment. Using the Manage option, you can create/update the alert and schedulers for experiments.
imageName3 = MLTK_3.png
imageCaption4 = The Models section lists all the old models created using the Machine Learning Toolkit Version 3.1 or below, and the models created using Splunk SPL. Details like Model Name, Algorithm Used, App Created In, and Owner are also available.

imageCaption5 = Lastly, the "Classic" tab contains Alerts, Scheduled Training, and Assistants that fall outside of the Experiments workflow (including those created in MLTK version 3.1 or below).
